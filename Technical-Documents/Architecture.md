# iOS Architecture

This document describes the current architecture approach for the iOS App.

## Holistic App Architecture

The application is structured using modularised architecture In this architecture, the App is separated into totally isolated Feature modules which depend on Shared and Core modules. Having isolated modules so people can work easily in separate cross-functional teams and it's easy to reuse modules as frameworks.

## Module Architecture

Each Module is using a [Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) architecture pattern with two additional patterns added:

- [Builder design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) - To construct objects and help with dependency management
- [Router pattern](https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/#routing) - A router (from the VIPER architecture) to abstract routing logic to a separate object which can reduce the amount of logic in the ViewController

By using these two additional patterns the architecture could be called MVVM-CB (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator-Builder).

All objects are defined by interfaces (`protocols`) to enable replacing them with mocked versions during (unit) testing. 

Examples: 

- `Builder`s are defined by `Buildable` interfaces
- `Coordinator`s are defined by `Coordinating` interfaces
- `ViewController`s are defined by `Presentable` or `NavigationControllable` interfaces

### Module

This is a modularized architecture, which means every isolated feature/functionality in the app is called a module. 

A module always consists of at least a `Builder` together with the object it builds. In most cases `Builder`s build `Coordinator`s. for example:
- `Builder` builds a `Module` which wraps a `Coordinator` which uses a `ViewController` to present other `viewController`s

What is unique in this architecture is that `Coordinators` talk to each other. To know what's that means let me take you on a small trip:
Let's say there are two modules `Module A` and `Module B`. Now from `Module A` would need to navigate to `Module B` to do that `Module A` coordinator would have to first ask the `Module B` builder to build the module(which is a wrapper around a coordinator). Once `Module A` gets `Module B` coordinator it would then call a method to start it. 
To achieve that a generic type called `Module` that wraps a coordinator is used:
``` swift
public struct Module<T> {
    public let coordinator: BaseCoordinator<T>
    
    public init(coordinator: BaseCoordinator<T>) {
        self.coordinator = coordinator
    }
}
```

Some examples of modules are: 
- Peripherals (consists of `PeripheralsModuleBuilder`, `PeripheralsCoordinator`, `PeripheralsUseCase` and `PeripheralsViewController`)

### Builder Pattern

To simplify object(Module) creation, and to remove the need to deal with dependencies during object creation, `Builder`s are used. `Builder`s can define the dependencies they require by creating a `Dependency` interface:

``` swift
/// Provides all dependencies to build the VenueDetailsModuleBuilder
private final class PeripheralDependencyProvider: DependencyProvider<EmptyDependency> {
    
    fileprivate var peripheralDetailsModuleBuilder: PeripheralDetailsModuleBuildable { PeripheralDetailsModuleBuilder() }
}
```

A builder specifies which dependency it requires, or can use `EmptyDependency` if no parent dependencies are needed:


``` swift
// 1)
public protocol PeripheralDetailsModuleBuildable: ModuleBuildable {
    func buildModule<T>(with rootViewController: NavigationControllable, peripheral: Peripheral) -> Module<T>?
}

// 2)
/// Provides all dependencies to build the VenueDetailsModuleBuilder
private final class PeripheralDetailsDependencyProvider: DependencyProvider<EmptyDependency> {    
}

// 3)
public class PeripheralDetailsModuleBuilder: Builder<EmptyDependency>, PeripheralDetailsModuleBuildable {
    
    public func buildModule<T>(with rootViewController: NavigationControllable, peripheral: Peripheral) -> Module<T>? {
        registerService(peripheral: peripheral.bkPeripheral)
        registerUsecase()
        registerViewModel(peripheral: peripheral)
        registerView()
        registerCoordinator(rootViewController: rootViewController)
        
        guard let coordinator = container.resolve(PeripheralDetailsCoordinator.self) else {
            return nil
        }
        
        return Module(coordinator: coordinator) as? Module<T>
    }
}
```

First, an interface is defined that describes the `PeripheralDetailsModuleBuilder`: its `buildModule` function and the interface of the to-be-built object. Any dynamic dependency (for example, a `peripheral`) can be passed as an argument to the `buildModule` method. 

Note: Usually builders return generic type `Module` to not leak implementation details to the call site. For example, it usually does not make sense for the parent module to call into coordinating functions of a child module.

Secondly, a `DependencyProvider` is created. `DependencyProvider`s can be constructed by the Builder to get dependencies from. Any local dependency can be constructed directly by the DependencyProvider:

These dependencies can be used by child builders later on. For an example, see the below Coordinator section.

Finally (3), a concrete `Builder` class is created. Its structure follows the same pattern: a `DependencyProvider` is created, any intermediate objects (in this case `PeripheralDetailsViewController`) are created and the final Module is constructed and returned.

### Coordinator

The Coordinator concept comes from VIPER (Router) and is used to extract router specific logic. A `Coordinator` has an associated `ViewController` that it uses to route with. 
Usually, coordinators call `present`/`dismiss`/`push`/`pop` methods on their `viewControllers`. ViewModels uses coordinators to initiate routing requests. 

A module with a coordinator is structured as follow:
`Builder` -> builds -> `Coordinator` -> uses `ViewController` -> uses `ViewModel` -> calls back into the same coordinator.

And Builder is usually created from previous screen's (Previous)Coordinator.

The relationship between coordinator and view model is established when creating the coordinator in the builder for example: 

```swift   
    func registerCoordinator(rootViewController: NavigationControllable? = nil) {
        container.register(PeripheralDetailsCoordinator.self) { [weak self] in
            guard let viewController = self?.container.resolve(PeripheralDetailsViewController.self) else {
                return nil
            }
            
            let coordinator = PeripheralDetailsCoordinator(rootViewController: rootViewController, viewController: viewController)
            coordinator.viewControllerDismissed = viewController.viewModel.outputs.viewControllerDismissed
            return coordinator
        }
    }
```

```swift  
class PeripheralDetailsCoordinator: BaseCoordinator<Void> {
    
    private weak var rootViewController: NavigationControllable?
    private let viewController: UIViewController
    
    var viewControllerDismissed = PublishSubject<Void>()

    init(rootViewController: NavigationControllable?, viewController: UIViewController) {
        self.rootViewController = rootViewController
        self.viewController = viewController
    }
    
    override public func start() -> Observable<Void> {
        rootViewController?.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
        
        return viewControllerDismissed.map { [weak self] in
            let _ = self?.rootViewController?.popViewController(animated: true)
        }
    }
}
```

### View Model

A view model is a viewâ€™s model. It encapsulates the data needed to populate a particular kind of view and the presentation logic needed to transform that data into properties that can be rendered.

The minimal ViewModel example looks as follows:

``` swift 
protocol PeripheralDetailsViewModellable: ViewModellable {
    var disposeBag: DisposeBag { get }
    var inputs: PeripheralDetailsViewModelInputs { get }
    var outputs: PeripheralDetailsViewModelOutputs { get }
}

struct PeripheralDetailsViewModelInputs {
    var viewState = PublishSubject<ViewState>()
    var viewControllerDismissed = PublishSubject<Void>()
}

struct PeripheralDetailsViewModelOutputs {
    var viewData = PublishSubject<PeripheralDetailsViewController.ViewData>()
    var viewControllerDismissed = PublishSubject<Void>()
    var showError = PublishSubject<Error>()
}

class PeripheralDetailsViewModel: PeripheralDetailsViewModellable {

    let disposeBag = DisposeBag()
    let inputs = PeripheralDetailsViewModelInputs()
    let outputs = PeripheralDetailsViewModelOutputs()
    private let useCase: PeripheralDetailsInteractable
    let peripheral: Peripheral
    
    init(useCase: PeripheralDetailsInteractable, peripheral: Peripheral) {
        self.useCase = useCase
        self.peripheral = peripheral
        
        setupObservables()
    }
}
```

### Inputs
All input variables `PublishSubject` types that are invoked directly when needed from the view.

``` swift 
        var viewControllerDismissed = PublishSubject<Void>()
```
### Outputs
All outputs to the external that triggers the next screen action observed by `Coordinator`.

``` swift
    var showError = PublishSubject<Error>()
```
